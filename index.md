## General

Composer, sound-artist, performer.

Born in Voronezh, Russia in 1999.

When I reached age of 16, I’ve started my professional musical education in Voronezh Musical College as a bassoon player, and then continued it in Music College after Gnesin family, Moscow. After I entered the Moscow Conservatory and studied composition with Vladimir Tarnopolsky (first year of study) and Yuri Kasparov (second year of study). 

Since the actions of the Russian government and the war with Ukraine, I was forced to depart my homeland for conscience and life safety in October 2022. Starting from the end of 2022 to the beginning of 2024, I’ve lived and worked in Yerevan as a school teacher of music and a tutor for kids with autism spectrum disorder.

Then I moved to Germany in 2024 and continued my Bachelor Studies in Musikhochschule Lübeck, where I'm also working as an assistant by the composition department and a technical assistant by the electronic studio.
